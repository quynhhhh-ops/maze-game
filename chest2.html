    <p>Not all Tay people can make the Oi flute. Currently, in the whole Tan Pheo commune, there are only about 10 people who know how to make the Oi flute. The Oi flute of the Tay people consists of 6 musical notes corresponding to 6 round holes created from a bamboo tube. To make an Oi flute, it is very elaborate and meticulous right from the time of choosing the bamboo. The bamboo to make the Oi flute must be old and slightly curved, it must have a tip, not a blunt tip, so that the flute can have sound. After choosing a qualified bamboo, the artisan performs the steps of making the Oi flute. First, take a soft bamboo strip and place it in the center of the flute, roll the strip into a circle as a measuring stick to divide the musical notes. After marking the musical notes, the artisan uses a stick to put it in hot coal to punch holes (musical notes) according to the marked positions.</p>
    <p>The Oi flute is the main instrument, indispensable to accompany songs throughout the Tay. However, the Oi flute is only used on happy days, holidays, Tet, the sacred moment of transition between the old year and the new year. In particular, the Oi flute is the flute that young men use to call their mates. In the customs of the Tay people, only boys are allowed to play the Oi flute, girls are absolutely not allowed to play it.</p>
